Project Title: Weather Forecast using Java and REST API
Objective:
To create a Java application that fetches and displays real-time weather information for any city using a REST API.
Description:
This project uses Java to connect to an online weather API. When the user enters a city name, the program sends a request to the API, gets the weather data in JSON format, and displays temperature, wind speed, weather condition, and time. JSON data is parsed using the `org.json` library.

How it works:
1. User inputs a city name.
2. API URL is created and a request is sent.
3. JSON response is received and parsed.
4. Weather details are shown in the console.
5. User is asked if they want to check another city.

Technologies Used:
Java, REST API, JSON-java library (`org.json`), VS Code or any Java IDE.
Output Example:
Enter a city name: Hyderabad
------ Weather Data for Hyderabad ------
Temperature: 30.0Â°C
Wind Speed: 16.7 km/h
Weather: Partly Cloudy (code 2)
Time: 2025-07-06T10:45

Conclusion:

This project shows how to use Java with APIs and JSON. It is useful for learning API calls, JSON parsing, and user interaction in Java.
